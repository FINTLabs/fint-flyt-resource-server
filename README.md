# FINT Flyt Resource Server

Reactive Spring Boot auto-configuration that standardizes OAuth2 resource-server behavior for FINT Flyt services.
It provisions WebFlux security filter chains for every internal/external API segment, enriches JWTs with Kafka-backed
permissions, and keeps derived authorities cached so downstream applications can guard their own HTTP endpoints with
consistent semantics.

## Highlights

- **Reactive security filter chains** — `SecurityConfiguration` builds dedicated WebFlux `SecurityWebFilterChain`s per
  API segment (internal admin, internal user, internal client, external) and applies a shared authorization log filter.
- **Multi-tenant policy control** — API segments are toggled through `novari.flyt.resource-server.security.api.*`
  properties, allowing each service to expose only the surfaces needed by its organization.
- **Kafka-backed authorization** — `SourceApplicationAuthorizationRequestService` performs request/reply lookups for
  source-application IDs, while `UserPermissionCachingListenerFactory` streams user permissions into cache.
- **FINT cache integration** — Long-lived permission data is stored in a `FintCache` to avoid repeated Kafka round-trips
  and to speed up role checks.
- **Observability ready** — Ships with Spring Boot Actuator enabled so every host service inherits health and metrics
  probes under `/actuator/**`.

## Architecture Overview

| Component                                   | Responsibility                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SecurityConfiguration`                     | Wires the actuator, admin, user, internal-client, and external filter chains with the proper matchers and order.   |
| `SecurityWebFilterChainFactoryService`      | Applies cross-cutting WebFlux security config (logging, CSRF off, JWT converter hookup, deny/permit helpers).      |
| `SourceApplicationJwtConverter`             | Converts external client JWTs into authorities by requesting authorization details over Kafka.                     |
| `InternalClientJwtConverter`                | Maps internal client subject claims to `CLIENT_ID_*` authorities used by the internal-client filter chain.         |
| `UserJwtConverter`                          | Enriches user tokens with org-filtered roles and cached source-application IDs retrieved from Kafka.               |
| `UserPermissionCachingListenerFactory`      | Builds a Kafka listener that keeps the `FintCache<UUID, UserPermission>` populated for the JWT converter.          |
| `SourceApplicationAuthorizationRequestService` | Manages Kafka request/reply infrastructure that resolves client IDs to source-application IDs.                   |
| `UserAuthorizationService`                  | Utility used by consumers of this starter to assert role membership or application-level access at runtime.        |

## HTTP API

Base paths guarded by the starter (see `UrlPaths`):

| Method | Path                     | Description                                                                                      | Request body                                   | Response                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ANY`  | `/api/intern/admin/**`   | Internal admin API requiring at least the `ADMIN` role; disabled unless `internal.enabled=true`. | – (implemented by the host service)            | Protected downstream response, `401/403` when the JWT misses authorities. |
| `ANY`  | `/api/intern/**`         | Internal user API requiring the `USER` role; filters allowed roles per organization.             | –                                              | Same as above.                                                           |
| `ANY`  | `/api/intern-klient/**`  | Internal client API secured by specific client IDs embedded in the JWT subject.                  | –                                              | Same as above.                                                           |
| `ANY`  | `/api/**`                | External API for approved source applications announced through Kafka.                           | –                                              | Same as above.                                                           |

Tokens are expected to include the claims below; the starter extracts them to compute granted authorities:

```json
{
  "organizationid": "vtfk.no",
  "objectidentifier": "7d9e0d20-2a50-4ca1-9e4f-7c79f5fbe6c0",
  "roles": [
    "https://role-catalog.vigoiks.no/vigo/flyt/user"
  ],
  "sub": "client-123" // internal/external clients rely on the subject as clientId
}
```

Errors fall back to Spring Security defaults: missing/invalid tokens result in `401 Unauthorized`, while denied
authorities answer with `403 Forbidden`.

## Kafka Integration

- `SourceApplicationAuthorizationRequestService` creates authorization request topics with the default org/application
  prefix, spins up short-lived reply topics (2-minute retention), and uses `RequestTemplate` to perform request/reply
  calls that translate client IDs to source-application IDs.
- `UserPermissionCachingListenerFactory` subscribes to the `userpermission` entity topic using
  `ParameterizedListenerContainerFactoryService`, writes records into the shared `FintCache`, and skips failed records
  through an `ErrorHandlerFactory`.
- Kafka connection, group IDs, and polling parameters rely on the shared `no.novari:kafka` helpers so the starter inherits
  FINT defaults (max poll settings, seek-to-beginning bootstrap, etc.).

## Scheduled Tasks

No scheduled jobs are defined; permission lifetimes are managed entirely through Kafka listeners and the configured cache
TTL (`novari.cache.default-cache-entry-time-to-live`) so no cron-like cleanup is needed.

## Configuration

Key properties exposed by the starter:

| Property                                                            | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `novari.flyt.resource-server.security.api.internal.enabled`         | Enables the internal admin/user APIs and registers the Kafka-backed user authorization beans.   |
| `novari.flyt.resource-server.security.api.internal.authorized-org-id-role-pairs-json` | JSON map of `{ "orgId": ["USER","ADMIN"] }` that filters allowed roles per organization.      |
| `novari.flyt.resource-server.security.api.internal-client.enabled`  | Turns on the internal client API filter chain.                                                  |
| `novari.flyt.resource-server.security.api.internal-client.authorized-client-ids` | List of JWT subjects that may call `/api/intern-klient/**`.                                  |
| `novari.flyt.resource-server.security.api.external.enabled`         | Turns on the external API filter chain.                                                         |
| `novari.flyt.resource-server.security.api.external.authorized-source-application-ids` | List of source-application IDs authorized for `/api/**`.                                     |
| `novari.kafka.application-id`                                       | Used for request/reply topic naming and listener group IDs.                                     |
| `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri`              | Issuer for JWT validation (`https://idp.felleskomponent.no/nidp/oauth/nam`).                    |
| `novari.cache.default-cache-entry-time-to-live`                     | Default cache TTL (10 years by default) for cached permission entries.                          |

Secrets supplied via the consuming service’s deployment (Kubernetes secret, Vault, etc.) must provide OAuth client data,
Kafka bootstrap credentials, and any organization-specific JSON payloads mentioned above.

## Running Locally

Prerequisites:

- Java 21+
- Gradle (wrapper included)
- Kafka broker (for running the permission listener/request-reply interactions)

Useful commands:

```shell
./gradlew clean build         # compile and run the full test suite
./gradlew test                # unit tests only
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal # install the starter locally so other apps can depend on it during development
```

To experiment with the starter inside another Spring Boot service, add `no.novari:fint-flyt-resource-server` as a
dependency, run a local Kafka broker (e.g., docker-compose), and enable the desired API segment:

```shell
SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON='{
  "novari":{
    "flyt":{
      "resource-server":{
        "security":{
          "api":{
            "internal":{
              "enabled":true,
              "authorized-org-id-role-pairs-json":"{\"vtfk.no\":[\"USER\",\"ADMIN\"]}"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "kafka":{
      "application-id":"fint-flyt-resource-server-local"
    }
  }
}' ./gradlew bootRun
```

## Deployment

- Artifacts are published to `https://repo.fintlabs.no/releases` via `./gradlew publish`, reusing the Gradle publishing
  credentials (`REPOSILITE_USERNAME/PASSWORD`).
- Consumers pull the starter as a Maven dependency; Spring Boot automatically discovers the auto-configurations through
  `META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports`.
- Coordinate releases with downstream services so they can bump the dependency version and align Kafka/OAuth settings.

## Security

- Configures Spring Security’s WebFlux resource server with issuer validation against `https://idp.felleskomponent.no`.
- Path-level segmentation ensures `/api/intern*` endpoints stay internal while `/api/**` is limited to authorized source
  applications derived from Kafka.
- `AuthorityMappingService` and `AuthorityPrefix` standardize how authorities are encoded and later parsed by consumer
  services.
- `AuthorizationLogFilter` traces Authorization headers (at TRACE level) to help diagnose token issues without leaking
  them in higher log levels.
- Internal role evaluation filters token roles per organization and expands implied roles (Developer → Admin → User).

## Observability & Operations

- Health and readiness probes are inherited through Spring Boot Actuator (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/readiness`,
  `/actuator/prometheus` when enabled by the host app).
- Cache state can be inspected via `FintCacheManager` metrics once Micrometer is enabled in the consuming service.
- Kafka listeners log consumed permission events at DEBUG so operators can trace authorization changes when needed.

## Development Tips

- When updating `authorized-org-id-role-pairs-json`, keep the payload valid JSON; the starter logs parse failures on
  startup.
- Use `UserAuthorizationService` inside host services to gate handlers the same way the filter chains do.
- Integration tests can mock `ReplyTopicService` and `RequestTemplateFactory` to avoid Kafka while still covering the
  JWT converters.
- `UserPermissionCachingListenerFactory` reuses default Kafka settings; override the listener configuration only if you
  truly need different poll sizes or retry logic.
